  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm sittin' here in the boring room\nIt's just another rainy Sunday afternoon\nI'm wastin' my time, I got nothin' to do\nI'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you\nBut nothing ever happens\nAnd I wonder\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm drivin' around in my car\nI'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far\nI'd like to change my point of view\nI feel so lonely, I'm waitin' for you\nBut nothing ever happens\nAnd I wonder\n\n[Chorus]\nI wonder how, I wonder why\nYesterday, you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky\nAnd all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree\nI'm turnin' my head up and down\nI'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around\nAnd all that I can see is just another lemon tree\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nSing\nDap, da-da-da-dam, di-dap-da\nDa-da-da-dam, di-dap-da\nDap, di-di-li-da\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm sittin' here, I missed the power\nI'd like to go out, takin' a shower\nBut there's a heavy cloud inside my head\nI feel so tired, put myself into bed\nWell, nothing ever happens\nAnd I wonder\n\n[Bridge]\nIsolation is not good for me\nIsolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree\n\n[Verse 4]\nI'm steppin' around in the desert of joy\nMaybe, anyhow, I'll get another toy\nAnd everything will happen\nAnd you wonder\n\n[Chorus]\nI wonder how, I wonder why\nYesterday, you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky\nAnd all that I can see is just another lemon tree\nI'm turnin' my head up and down\nI'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around\nAnd all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree\nAnd I wonder, wonder, I wonder how, I wonder why\nYesterday, you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky\nAnd all that I can see (Ah, dip-dip-dip-dip)\nAnd all that I can see (Ah, dip-dip-dip-dip)\nAnd all that I can see\nIs just a yellow lemon tree"
